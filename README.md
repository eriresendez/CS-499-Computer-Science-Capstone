# CS-499-Computer-Science-Capstone

## **Professional Self-Assessment**

My journey through Southern New Hampshire University's Computer Science program, which began in 2022, has been an incredibly transformative experience that shaped both my technical skills and professional identity. The curriculum provided a strong foundation in programming, software design, and secure system architecture while encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving. Developing this ePortfolio has given me the opportunity to reflect on that growth and highlight how my coursework, projects, and experiences have prepared me to enter the computer science field as a confident, capable developer. Each artifact included here represents not just technical mastery, but also my ability to design, collaborate, and communicate effectively in a professional environment.
### Core Competencies and Professional Development

Early foundation courses such as IT-145: Foundation in Application Development helped me master core programming principles, including object-oriented design, modular development, and structured problem-solving. These fundamentals became essential as I advanced through courses that required designing larger, more complex systems. One of the courses I appreciated the most was CS-260: Data Structures and Algorithms, where I developed a deep understanding of how algorithms and data structures form the backbone of all software systems. I discovered how much I enjoyed designing algorithms, and this class reinforced my appreciation for their central role in programming. This knowledge became especially valuable in my later work, such as implementing efficient CRUD operations and optimization logic in my Grazioso Salvare Dashboard and designing a collision detection algorithm for my 3D Scene Replication Project.

Throughout my coursework, I also developed strong collaboration and communication skills. Team-based projects such as DriverPass required frequent communication with simulated clients and stakeholders to gather requirements, design system architectures, and present technical solutions in clear, understandable ways. These experiences helped me bridge the gap between technical and non-technical communication, a vital skill in real-world software development. 

My coursework in software engineering, databases, and cybersecurity strengthened my understanding of system design and data management. In multiple projects, I applied software engineering principles to create scalable, maintainable applications with clear documentation and structured testing. The integration of secure authentication systems, role-based access control, and database management using MongoDB in my Grazioso Salvare Dashboard artifact highlights my ability to design secure, full-stack applications. These projects reflect my commitment to writing clean, efficient, and secure code, values that I intend to carry into my professional career.

### Artifacts

The three artifacts in this portfolio were carefully selected to demonstrate a diverse yet interconnected set of competencies across the computer science discipline, showcasing my evolution from classroom learning to production-ready development.

[Artifact One](https://github.com/eriresendez/CS-499-Computer-Science-Capstone/blob/main/CS340/Artifact%20One/Artifact_One_animal_shelter_CRUD.py) represents an enhancement of the Grazioso Salvare Dashboard that focuses on data engineering and end-user operational value. In this artifact, I transformed a MongoDB-dependent application into a portable, dependency-light solution by migrating from database queries to CSV-based data processing. This enhancement demonstrates my ability to assess architectural trade-offs and prioritize accessibility over complexity. Beyond the migration, I integrated professional reporting capabilities including multi-format export functionality (CSV, JSON, Excel) and sophisticated PDF report generation using ReportLab. The PDF reports feature structured layouts with rescue team statistics, operational metrics, and animal data tables, transforming raw data into actionable intelligence for field operations. This artifact showcases my understanding that software engineering isn't just about technical implementation; it's about delivering practical value to end users through thoughtful design decisions and clear documentation.

[Artifact Two](https://github.com/eriresendez/CS-499-Computer-Science-Capstone/blob/main/CS330/Artifact%20Two/CS-499%20Artifact%20Two.zip) demonstrates my proficiency in C++, OpenGL, and real-time system design through a 3D Scene Replication with Collision Detection. This project represents a significant algorithmic achievement, where I designed and implemented a comprehensive collision detection system supporting multiple geometric primitives: sphere-sphere, sphere-box, and sphere-capsule collisions. The collision algorithm required deep understanding of 3D geometry, vector mathematics, and spatial reasoning. I implemented optimized distance calculations, including a point-to-line distance function for capsule collisions that handles edge cases and maintains numerical stability. The system integrates seamlessly with camera movement, providing real-time collision resolution that prevents the camera from passing through scene objects. I also implemented a debug visualization system using OpenGL wireframe rendering to display collision bounds as colored overlays, demonstrating my ability to build developer tools that facilitate testing and refinement. This artifact emphasizes my capacity to design and optimize algorithms for performance-critical applications while maintaining clean, well-documented code architecture.

[Artifact Three](https://github.com/eriresendez/CS-499-Computer-Science-Capstone/blob/main/CS340/Artifact%20Three/ArtifiactThreeDashboard.ipynb) returns to the Grazioso Salvare Dashboard with a focus on full-stack development, secure backend services, and advanced data visualization. This enhancement integrates JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (admin, analyst, viewer roles), bcrypt password hashing, and comprehensive audit logging that tracks all user actions with timestamps and IP addresses. The security implementation includes token verification, session management, and user lifecycle operations (creation, deactivation, privilege escalation). On the database side, I leveraged MongoDB's aggregation pipeline to implement sophisticated analytics including breed performance metrics, rescue type analytics with breed-specific breakdowns, monthly adoption trends with animal type segmentation, and demographic distribution analysis. The dashboard features interactive data visualizations using Plotly and Dash, presenting complex queries as intuitive charts and graphs. I also implemented graceful degradation, when MongoDB is unavailable, the system switches to demo mode with mock data, ensuring the application remains functional for testing and demonstration purposes. This artifact reflects my versatility as a full-stack developer capable of integrating authentication, database optimization, real-time visualization, and user experience design into cohesive, production-grade applications.

Together, these artifacts illustrate my range as a computer science professional: from backend engineering and data processing (Artifact One) to real-time graphics and algorithm design (Artifact Two) to full-stack secure application development (Artifact Three). In unison, my coursework and these projects showcase my evolution into a well-rounded developer, someone who can analyze complex problems, design efficient algorithms, communicate effectively with stakeholders, and build secure, user-focused software solutions. This program has not only strengthened my technical expertise but also shaped my professional values of integrity, collaboration, and continuous learning. The skills and problem-solving abilities demonstrated in this portfolio have prepared me to make an immediate and meaningful contribution in a professional software engineering role.
